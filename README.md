# assorted tools

tools I made and use
feel free 2 use + modify

## in the image_manipulation_scripts directory:

gif_splitter.py and image_resizer.py are made to be used together. I wrote them for this [project](https://github.com/anthonyjdelpino/pets-4-max).

gif_splitter.py will print the directory it put the frame images in, this can be piped into image_resizer.py

image_resizer.py will not resize gifs frame by frame and does not create backups, so be careful with it. It will verify if you want to continue, should you use it on a directory as it will resize everything in the directory (non-recursively).

## palette_compare.py:

Script runs on Fedora with Xwayland. User must have permission to access the X server.

Gets the pixel under the cursor's RGB value then compares it to colors in a palette. Currently set up to find the closest in the PICO-8 color palette and in a dithered PICO-8 color palette (generated by mixing pairs of PICO08 colors). After finding the nearest dithered color, will return the indices of the original PICO-8 colors used to generate the color in the dithered palette.
